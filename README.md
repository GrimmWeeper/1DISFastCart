# FastCart

This project was developed as part of our **50.001 Introduction to Information Systems & Programming** module in **SUTD**.

## Description
FastCart is an innovative solution that provides supermarkets with an integrated, zero-hassle digital checkout system that augments the traditional customer experience instead of deconstructing it, not compromising on issues such as privacy or cost.

## Functionalities
The FastCart App will mainly function to:
- Allow users to add and remove products from a validated cart as they shop, and subsequently at the end save time by checking out at any time they finish shopping.
- Check the items that have been added to their cart and view the total price of it. 
- Remove items from their cart simply by swiping their items to the right in the app. 
- Checkout their items by simply clicking the ‘checkout’ button to pay for their items and end the session.
